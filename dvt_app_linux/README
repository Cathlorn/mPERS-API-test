DVT:
Dvt program should have an argument maybe '-t' that will show all available tests
It will take as an argument the test number to perform and return the result.
Default test timeout will be 40 seconds for any send and 15 seconds for any receive.

Additional arguments may be given

Send Panics [number: default = 1] -> exit when tx empty
Send Falls [number: default = 1]-> exit when tx empty
Send Operator Ack [number: default = 1] -> exit when tx empty
Send Dynamic Vitals [number: default = 1] -> exit when tx empty
Send Invalid Msg [number: default = 1] -> exit when tx empty (puts garbage  in a good crc to hang the system)
Listen for Message [number: default = 1] -> exit when 40s of silence
For the DVT if we want to get more output use '-v'
Also -d [crc,spotty [%], ack] to be able to respectively corrupt the crc, do spotty rx, and never acknowledge packtets from the myHalo UDP level for additional test flexibility
-h and -p and -s are still valid, maybe add a -? to display all these arguments
